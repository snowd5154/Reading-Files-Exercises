# The seek() method takes two arguments:
# offset: the position to move to
# whence (optional): The reference point.

file = open("example.txt", "r")
file.seek(5)  # Move to the 6th byte in the file
content = file.read()
print(content)

#The tell() method returns the current position
# of the file handle, which is the number of bytes
# from the beginning of the file

file = open("example.txt", "r")
file.read(5)
position = file.tell()
print(position)  # Output: 5
